# Objectives:

In this project, you will be testing the Partition Tolerance of a NoSQL DB using the procedures described in the following article:  https://www.infoq.com/articles/jepsen. In addition, you will be developing a Data Service API in Go and deploying the API on AWS.

# Requirements:

* Select one CP and one AP NoSQL Database. 
* For example: Mongo and Riak (Note: Other NoSQL DBs that can be configured in CP or AP mode are also allowed).
* For each Database:
  - Set up your cluster as AWS EC2 Instances.  (# of Nodes and Topology is open per your design)
  - Set up the Experiments (i.e. Test Cases), run the Experiments and record the results for both AP and CP.
* For one of your NoSQL database, develop the Go API and integrate the API with the Team SaaS App from the Hackathon Project.
* Project must be use in a GitHub Repo (assigned by TA) to maintain source code, documentation and design diagrams.
* Repo will be maintain in:  https://github.com/nguyensjsu (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.
* Keep a Project Journal (as a markdown document) recording weekly progress, challenges, tests and test results.
* All documentation must be written in GitHub Markdown (including diagrams) and committed to GitHub.

# Week 1:

* Objective ---> Initial Research on the basic understanding and functionality of the project, studying the requriements, identifying the key aspects and figuring out the necessary technologies to be used.

# Task 1:

1) Studying NoSQL Databases
2) Understanding CAP Theorem
3) Understanding the requirements and architecture of the project through the article - https://www.infoq.com/articles/jepsen
4) Researching on the NoSQL DB to be used for both CP and AP.
5) Understanding Partition Tolerance and its pitfalls.
6) Studying other related terminologies required for the project.
