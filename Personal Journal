Project Objective: 
(i)  Testing the partition tolerance of a NoSQL DB.
(ii) Developing the Data Service API in GO & Deploying the API in AWS.

CAP Theorem - States that it is impossible for a distributed data store to simultaneously provide more than two of the following three guarantees:

CONSISTENCY         -> Every read receives the most recent write or an error.
AVAILIBILITY        -> Every request receives a response that is not an error.
PARTITION TOLERANCE -> The system continues to operate despite an arbitrary number of messages being dropped (or delayed) by the network between nodes

Latency - Time interval between the stimulation and response, or a time delay between the cause and the effect of some physical change in the system being observed.

Type of failure where messages are arbitarily delayed or dropped is called network partition.

Testing Partitions:

Need a collection of nodes to test.
 
-> Use 5 EC2 nodes.
-> the nodes shoould share a network of some kind. (maybe a single virtual bridge interface)
-> name the nodes n1, n2, n3, n4 and n5.
-> set up DNS between them and the host OS.

To cause a partition, need a way to drop or delay messages.

On Linux, can use iptables -A INPUT -s some-peer -j DROP to cause a unidirectional partition.
