Project Objective: 
(i)  Testing the partition tolerance of a NoSQL DB.
(ii) Developing the Data Service API in GO & Deploying the API in AWS.

CAP Theorem - States that it is impossible for a distributed data store to simultaneously provide more than two of the following three guarantees:

CONSISTENCY         -> Every read receives the most recent write or an error.
AVAILIBILITY        -> Every request receives a response that is not an error.
PARTITION TOLERANCE -> The system continues to operate despite an arbitrary number of messages being dropped (or delayed) by the network between nodes
