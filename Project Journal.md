# Objectives:

In this project, you will be testing the Partition Tolerance of a NoSQL DB using the procedures described in the following article: https://www.infoq.com/articles/jepsen. In addition, you will be developing a Data Service API in Go and deploying the API on AWS.

# Requirements:
* Select one CP and one AP NoSQL Database.
* For example: Mongo and Riak (Note: Other NoSQL DBs that can be configured in CP or AP mode are also allowed).
* For each Database:
* Set up your cluster as AWS EC2 Instances. (# of Nodes and Topology is open per your design)
* Set up the Experiments (i.e. Test Cases), run the Experiments and record the results for both AP and CP.
* For one of your NoSQL database, develop the Go API and integrate the API with the Team SaaS App from the Hackathon Project.
* Project must be use in a GitHub Repo (assigned by TA) to maintain source code, documentation and design diagrams.
* Repo will be maintain in: https://github.com/nguyensjsu (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.
* Keep a Project Journal (as a markdown document) recording weekly progress, challenges, tests and test results.
* All documentation must be written in GitHub Markdown (including diagrams) and committed to GitHub.
